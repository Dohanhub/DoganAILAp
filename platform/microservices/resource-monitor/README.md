# Resource Monitor Microservice

## Purpose
- Real-time hardware utilization monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk, network) for all microservices
- Dashboard integration for live stats and alerts
- Capacity planning and hardware recommendation support

## Features
- RESTful API for current and historical resource usage
- Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint
- Alerts if usage nears hardware limits
- Designed for portable/mini-PC/mobile service stations (up to 128GB RAM)

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: API skeleton, config, and health endpoints
- Phase 2: Real-time stats collection and Prometheus integration
- Phase 3: Capacity planning and hardware recommendation logic
