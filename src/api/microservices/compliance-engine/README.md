# Compliance Engine Microservice

## Purpose
- Core compliance logic for all KSA regulations (NCA, SAMA, MoH, etc.)
- Modular, extensible, API-first design
- Supports plug-in rules, mappings, and sector-specific logic

## Features
- RESTful API for compliance evaluation
- Loads benchmarks and mappings from the benchmarks service
- Extensible for new regulations and custom rules
- Designed for on-prem, secure, and high-performance operation

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: API skeleton, config, and health endpoints
- Phase 2: Load and evaluate benchmarks, sector-specific logic
- Phase 3: Plug-in system for new rules and mappings
