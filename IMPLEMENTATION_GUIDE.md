## 🚀 How to Execute Everything

### Step 1: Run the Complete Setup Script
```powershell
# In PowerShell, from your project root:
.\setup_complete.ps1
```

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Add these secrets:
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY`
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` 
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- `KUBECONFIG`

### Step 3: Local Development
```bash
# Run all setup commands at once:
make bootstrap && make up && make migrate && make seed && make health
```

### Step 4: Production Deployment
**Option 1 - CI/CD (Recommended):**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Option 2 - Manual Deployment:**
```bash
make release
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### Local Development
- `make bootstrap` - Set up environment and dependencies
- `make up` - Start all services with Docker Compose
- `make logs` - View application logs
- `make down` - Stop all services
- `make migrate` - Run database migrations
- `make seed` - Seed database with initial data
- `make health` - Check application health

### Production Operations
- `make build` - Build Docker image
- `make push` - Push image to registry
- `make release` - Build, push, and deploy to Kubernetes
- `make kube-apply` - Deploy to Kubernetes
- `make kube-rollback` - Rollback deployment

### Development Tools
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make lint` - Check code quality
- `make fmt` - Format code

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Edit `.env` file with your configuration:
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY` - Your Docker registry
- `PORT` - Application port (default: 3000)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret

### Kubernetes Configuration
- Update `k8s/ingress.yaml` with your domain
- Configure secrets in Kubernetes cluster
- Set `K8S_NAMESPACE` variable in GitHub Actions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
2. **Port conflicts**: Change PORT in .env
3. **Database connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL
4. **Kubernetes deployment**: Check KUBECONFIG secret

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check application health
make health

# View logs
make logs

# Check Kubernetes pods
kubectl get pods -n prod
```

- **Codex Agent**: See `codex/agent.yml` for automation capabilities
- **Tasks**: See `codex/tasks/` for detailed task documentation
- **Policy**: See `codex/prompts/policy.md` for security guidelines
- **Runbooks**: See `codex/tasks/ops_runbooks.md` for operations procedures

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] All files created successfully
- [ ] GitHub Actions secrets configured
- [ ] Local environment set up (`make bootstrap && make up`)
- [ ] Database migrated and seeded (`make migrate && make seed`)
- [ ] Application healthy (`make health`)
- [ ] Production deployment tested (push to main or `make release`)
