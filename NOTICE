Third-Party Notices and Attribution

This project depends on open-source components. Their licenses are included
with the distributed artifacts or can be referenced via the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

How to retrieve SBOM and licenses:
- CI generates an SBOM (SPDX JSON) for published images (see .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml).
- SBOM includes package names, versions, and license metadata.

Major components (non-exhaustive):
- Python: FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Requests, Prometheus Client
- Node/Next.js for the web application

You must comply with the license terms of each third-party component.
For questions or to request a complete license report, contact the maintainers.
